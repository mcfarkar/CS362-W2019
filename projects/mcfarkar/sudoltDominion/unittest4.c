** File: unittest4.c
** Purpose: Write unit tests for the function supplyCount
**          int supplyCount(int card, struct gameState *state)
** Goal: Write unit tests for four functions (not card implementations, and not cardEffect) 
** in dominion.c “the refactored code you created for assignment-2”. 
** Check these tests in as unittest1.c,unittest2.c, unittest3.c, and unittest4.c. 
** At least two of these functions should be more than 5 lines of code.
